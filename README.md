A console chess game built using C language, featuring basic rule enforcement, piece movement, and two-player gameplay.

## 📌 What is this project?

This is a console-based **chess game written in C**, supporting two-player mode (White vs Black). It runs entirely in the terminal and features piece movement logic, a chessboard display, turn-based play, and basic rule enforcement.

## 🧠 Why did I make it?

I'm a student currently learning C programming, and I wanted to **test my understanding of data structures, logic, and user interaction** by creating something complex but practical. Chess seemed like a great way to combine:
- Grid-based board logic
- Conditional rules and movement
- Turn-based logic
- Problem-solving and debugging

## 🛠️ How it works

The game uses a simple 8x8 2D array to represent the board. Pieces are characters:
- **White pieces are uppercase** (`K`, `Q`, `B`, `N`, `R`, `P`)
- **Black pieces are lowercase** (`k`, `q`, `b`, `n`, `r`, `p`)

Moves are entered using chess notation (e.g., `e2 e4`). The code checks for valid movement and alternating turns.
