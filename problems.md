## ‚ùå Problem 1: Castling Is Not Functional

**Description:**  
Castling is not working.

**Expected Behavior:**  
When castling conditions are met:
- King should move two squares toward the rook.
- Rook should jump over and land beside the king.
- All validations (no check, no pieces between, neither piece has moved) should be enforced.

**Possible Causes:**  
- Incomplete castling logic in the move validator.
- Not properly tracking whether king or rook has moved.
- Not clearly checking if king is in, moves through, or ends in check.

## ‚ùå Problem 2: Checkmate Not Automatically Detected

**Description:**  
Even when one side is in checkmate (king is under threat and has no legal moves), the game does not end or show a checkmate message.

**Expected Behavior:**  
Game should detect when the player has no legal moves **and** their king is in check, then display "Checkmate" and declare the winner.

**Possible Causes:**  
- No loop scanning all possible legal moves for the current player.
- Check logic may not detect all threat vectors.
- Game continues assuming moves are still possible.
